# Note: Executed by startx only if .xinitrc does not exist.
# More details: if .xinitrc exists, it is executed. If not, the system xinitrc
# is executed, which invokes system Xsession file, which, in turn, invokes this
# file - the user's .xsession file.
# If using .xinitrc instead, note that the system Xsession file will not be called
# and some tasks that are done by it will not be done.

# this should be sourced by one of Xsession scripts.
# required when starting the session via a display manager,
# but not when starting from a shell with startx.
